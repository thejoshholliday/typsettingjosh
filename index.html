	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Gather all the ingredients and equipments. You will need a medium saucepan, a heatproof mixing bowl (to set over the saucepan), and 2 large bowls. Make sure one of the large bowls can fit the mixing bowl and fill it with ice water, and set aside for Step 6.</li>
		<li>In the saucepan, fill with 2 inches of water. Set the mixing bowl over and make sure the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Remove the bowl (will use it shortly for egg custard), and bring the water to barely a simmer, and reduce the heat to low.</li>
		<li>In the heatproof mixing bowl, add egg yolks, marsala wine, and 3 Tbsp granulated sugar and start whisking with a handheld electric mixer.</li>
		<li>Set the bowl over the saucepan of barely simmering water and continue to beat the eggs. Keep your instant thermometer handy as you will be checking the temperature of the egg mixture. To consume Tiramisu safely, heat the egg yolk mixture until it reaches 160ºF (71ºC), about 10 minutes. </li>
		<li>Cook, beating constantly, until the custard is light and thick.</li>
		<li>Once the custard reaches 160ºF (71ºC), immediately remove the bowl from the saucepan and set in a large bowl of ice water. Let it cool down for 1 minute to quickly stop cooking.</li>
		<li>Put the mascarpone in another large bowl and soften it with a silicone spatula. Gradually fold the custard into the mascarpone.</li>
		<li>Take note: the egg yolk mixture does get cooked a bit on the side of the bowl from the double boiler. Do not scrape off to use it.</li>
		<li>Gently fold in until just smooth (the custard will be grainy if over mixed).</li>
		<li>In a large bowl (you can reuse the bowl from ice bath, but make sure it's completely dry), beat heavy (whipping) cream until foamy, and gradually add sugar.</li>
		<li>Beat until medium peak forms.</li>
		<li>Gradually fold in the heavy cream mixture into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
		<li>Fold in the mixture until well combined.</li>
		<li>Combine the hot water (175ºF/80ºC) and matcha powder and whisk until there is no lumps.  Transfer to a flat-bottom container that fits ladyfingers.</li>
		<li>Spread half of the mascarpone custard over the ladyfingers. Smooth out the surface.</li>
		<li>Dip the remaining ladyfingers in the matcha mixture and place them on top of the custard.</li>
		<li>Top with the remaining custard, smooth out the top, and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap to cover the cream. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
		<span> <li>Before serving, dust with matcha powder and enjoy!</li> </span>
